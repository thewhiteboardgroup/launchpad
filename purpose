Purpose

Whiteboard is an independent research group focused on asking how and why instead of what and who.

There are tens (perhaps even hundreds) of thousands of brilliant young people seeking to understand the increasingly complex world around them,
but no place for them to collaborate on projects or share their discoveries.
Fully realized, Whiteboard aims to serve this purpose.

Our aim is to realize everything a modern research institution could (and should) be;
An eclectic synthesis of young minds, open source software, digital research, and community.
